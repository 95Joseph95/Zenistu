    <h1>Zenitsu, quick as lightning, and scared of his own thunder! </h2>

          width="450px" height="280px">Zenitsu's full name is Zenitsu Agatsuma. It has been confirmed by the mangaka of the Demon Slayer: Kimetsu No Yaibu manga that his name Zenitsu means "goodness" while his surname means "my wife". The creator of the mangaka said in an interview that, when pronouncing his name, lesser emphasis should be given to "zen" and more to "suu." In other words, the last syllable of his name is meant to be dragged out.</p>
          <p>Zenitsu creates his own form called Seventh Form: Honoikazuchi   Nokami. Through this form, he is able to conjure a creature akin to a dragon that breathes thunder and fire. When combined with God Speed, his power and strength increase, giving him the ability to defeat demons like Kaiju, from the Upper Moon Six.</p>

          width="450px" height="280px">The name of Zenitsu's master or sensei is Jigoro Kuwajima. He was a strict but kind man who taught Zenitsu the ways of a Demon Slayer. The young boy looked up to him as a father figure and always strove hard to live up to his sensei's expectations. He admired and revered Jigoro, and it was these very feelings for him that helped Zenitsu overcome his cowardly nature.</p>
          <p>This is a manga-only incident that occurs in the Dimensional Infinity Fortress arc. Zenitsu meets his long lost senpai Kaigaku, but, to his shock, Kaigaku is no longer human, but a demon. Upon realizing that, Zenitsu denounces him as his senpai.</p>

          width="450px" height="280px">It’s been shown that Zenitsu has a very unique way of fighting. Whenever he faces any danger, he usually passes out due to extreme cowardice, and that, in an unconscious state, his subconscious mind takes over, and he fights like a pro. This is because, in this state of mind, his body moves based on pure instinct, which means his level of swordsmanship is very high, as is his ability to defend himself against high ranking demons.</p>
          <p>When the demon provokes Zenitsu by calling him a coward, the boy doesn’t give in to his emotions. He simply replies calmly that, for someone who simply filled an empty slot in the lowest-ranked of the Upper Moons, Kaigaku sure had a lot of opinions.</p>

When combined with God Speed, his power and strength increase, giving him the ability to defeat demons like Kaiju, from the Upper Moon Six.</p> 
          <p>In the very same scene, Zenitsu berates Kaigaku for being the reason their sensei committed suicide. It is then revealed that, because Kaigaku became a demon, their master could not bear the shame and committed seppuku, which was a painful and slow death for him. Kaigaku then goes on to berate their sensei, calling him senile.</p>
